3 main parts to our operations - the setup, our development and our CI/CD pipeline

for our setup
automate as much manual steps - mini bash scripts

during our development
use tool called terraform
IaC which means - Terraform scripts - deploy aws infrastructure

finally we built our CI/CD pipeline w github actions and a yaml script
when we upload our code,
our tests AND our terraform scripts run AUTOMATICALLY on a github provided machine - achieving 

that's our devops . melanie will now present some data as a result of our projects
